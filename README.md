#  Real-Time Detection of Missing Helmets and Bike Number Plate Identification
## Introduction

Real-time Helmet Missing Detection and Number Plate Recognition is a comprehensive project that aims to enhance road safety by addressing two critical aspects:

1. **Helmet Missing Detection**: This component of the project focuses on identifying motorcycle riders who are not wearing helmets. It uses computer vision techniques to analyze real-time camera feeds and instantly alerts authorities when a violation is detected.

2. **Number Plate Recognition**: The second component involves recognizing and extracting license plate information from vehicles in real-time. This feature is valuable for various applications, including traffic management, parking systems, and law enforcement.

## Helmet Missing Detection

The helmet missing detection module uses computer vision techniques to:

- Detect faces and riders on motorcycles.
- Determine whether the rider is wearing a helmet.
- Trigger alerts or notifications when a violation is detected.

## Number Plate Recognition

The number plate recognition module uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to:

- Detect license plates on vehicles.
- Extract the image of the license plate.
- Extract and Display the recognized license plate information in real-time.

## Project Status

This project is currently under active development and code may not be available until work has been done.


## Demo of Current Status
- It detects the number real time but it needs a higher resolution video.
